# Python Challenge

This excercise contained two challenges, both of which required reading in a csv, performing some calculations on the data, and outputting the results into a text file, all without using pandas. 

### PyPoll

The PyPoll challenge required reading in a csv file containing a list of voter ID's and the candidates they voted for. The goal was to write a script that would count the number of votes for each candidate, calculate a winner, and then output the final results both in the terminal and to a text file. 

### PyBank 

The PyBank challenge required reading in a csv file containing a list of dates and profits/losses. The goal was to write a script that would calculate the change in profit/loss over the entire time period, the average monthly change, and find the greatest increase and decrease in profits, then output the results.
